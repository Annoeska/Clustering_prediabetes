# Prediabetes_clustering

This folder shows the files needed for the prediabetes clustering with metabolomics profiling and analyses of lifestyle factors.   

	The Scripts directory includes the seperate file for all parts of the analysis. 
 	00_functions.Rmd contains all functions that are used in this analysis
	01_mainfile.Rmd is the parent Rmd file and could be used to knit the other Rmd files. 
	The files can also be run seperately, without knitting. In that case, make sure to load the packages in the parent file first.
